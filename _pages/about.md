I am a first year Statistics PhD student at the University of Kent and a member of the Statistical Ecology @ Kent (SE@K) research group. I am an Associate Member of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), as I was a 2023 IMA Graduate Prize Winner. 

My PhD project aims to bring together Multiple Systems Estimation and Capture-Recapture modelling approaches and provide a general and unifying modelling framework for human population registers. The new models to be developed will be applied to data from Sweden and we will obtain estimates of population size for different sub-populations as well as the probability of individuals of certain characteristics. We aim to estimate over-coverage within the population as well as account for temporary emigration within the model which is something that MSE cannot account for.

I completed an Integrated Masters in Mathematics (MMath) at the University of Dundee in 2023, with my Honours project titled "Dundee by Numbers: Examining the Attainment Gap", supervised by Dr Eric Hall, and my Masters project titled "Rogue Waves in the Ocean", supervised by Dr Agis Athanassoulis.  



This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
